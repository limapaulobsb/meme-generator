# Project Meme Generator

[Live demo](https://phlima.com/projects/meme-generator)

Last updated: October 2023

## Context

Meme Generator was proposed as a bonus project for block 5 of the [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/) Web Development course. In this block we study fundamental JavaScript concepts such as the DOM ([Document Object Model](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/)), element manipulation, events and [Web Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API).

## Stack used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)

This project was my first contact with the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API), an interface that uses JavaScript and the HTML element `<canvas>` for graphic manipulation.
